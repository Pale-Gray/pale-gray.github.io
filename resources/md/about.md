# About

I've been programming for awhile now, I can't name an exact date but I'd say around 2019 or so. I think I'll make a blog post about it to serve as a test to this website.  

I personally use C# mainly now, but I have used Java and Python before, but Java more actively. I have tried other languages but they were more for testing out the language or getting a feel for it.  

I'm currently working on a game right now, and it actually has a [github](https://github.com/Pale-Gray/BlockGame-OpenTK) that gets updated every now and then.

This site might have changes to it over time, but I like the way it is right now.

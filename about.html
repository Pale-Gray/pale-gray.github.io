<p>I've been programming for awhile now, I can't name an exact date but I'd say around 2019 or so. I think I'll make a blog post about it to serve as a test to this website.  </p>
<p>I personally use C# mainly now, but I have used Java and Python before, but Java more actively. I have tried other languages but they were more for testing out the language or getting a feel for it.  </p>
<p>I'm currently working on a game right now, and it actually has a <a href="https://github.com/Pale-Gray/BlockGame-OpenTK">github</a> that gets updated every now and then.</p>
<p>This site might have changes to it over time, but I like the way it is right now.</p>
